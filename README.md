# Alternate Approach: Converting Image and Text into Summaries and Creating Embeddings for Enhanced Retrieval

## Introduction

This approach offers an innovative solution for multimodal search by converting extracted text and images from documents (e.g., PDFs) into summaries. These summaries are then embedded, allowing for efficient and semantic-based retrieval in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Extracting Data from PDFs
Extract key elements such as text, tables, and images from PDFs.

### 2. Generating Summaries
- **Text Summarization:** Use GROQ (Llama-3.1-8b-instant) for text summarization.
- **Image Summarization:** Use GPT-4o-mini for summarizing images and tables.

### 3. Storing Summaries in Chroma Vector Store
Store the summarized content in a Chroma vector store for semantic-based retrieval.

### 4. Building the RAG Pipeline
Integrate summarized embeddings with the retrieval process, using a custom function to handle both text and image data.

### 5. Handling Multimodal Data
Ensure that the system processes both text and images in a unified pipeline, generating context-aware prompts for accurate answers.
